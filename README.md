## Overview

TaskFlow is a Django-based to-do list application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. Users can create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed, providing a simple and organized way to stay productive.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to add tasks to my to-do list so that I can keep track of what I need to do.
- As a user, I want to mark tasks as completed so that I can see what I have accomplished.
- As a user, I want to delete tasks so that I can remove items I no longer need.
- As a user, I want to edit a task's details so that I can update its description or due date.
- As a user, I want to view all my tasks in one place so that I can easily manage them.

## Design

### Wireframes

Wireframes for TaskFlow were created to visualize the layout and user interface of the application. These wireframes include:

- Home Page: Displays a list of tasks with options to add, edit and delete.

## Testing and Validation

### Testing Results

### Validation

## Python Validation

All python files were validated using the Code Institute Python Linter

All files generating the "E501 line too long" error are automatically generated by Django. The custom files have already been fixed and pass validation without any issues.
